# **End-to-End Loan Repayment Prediction Model**

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict loan repayment outcomes based on borrower data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, optimization, and deployment using **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## **Features**
- Predicts whether a borrower will fully repay their loan or default.
- Incorporates **9,579 records** with 13 features, including financial and credit-related attributes.
- Provides an intuitive and interactive **Streamlit** web application for real-time predictions.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold
  - **Model Serialization:** Joblib
- **Deployment Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
